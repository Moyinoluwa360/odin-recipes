    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor.
         It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. 
         It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass 
         cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!
