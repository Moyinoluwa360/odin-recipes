    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Asimple vanilla cake recipe is the perfect introductory cake for beginners, as well as a versatile standby for more experienced bakers to have on hand. 
        While there’s a whole, huge, hyper-calorific world of complicated cakes out there to explore, from red velvet cakes to lemon drizzle cakes, this easy 
        cake recipe is where it all begins and it's worth mastering so you can get the basics of cake making under your belt before you start to jazz it up with
         flavour additions and decorating finesse.</p>

    <p> A simple vanilla cake recipe does what it says on the tin: provides you with a delicate, moist and flavourful cake that can serve as a base for something
         more elaborate, please a host of children clamouring for something sweet or provide a simple sugar fix. This is a cake recipe that works splendidly for 
         birthdays, special occasions, or just that celebrated English ceremony, afternoon tea. We also believe that you never need a reason to make or eat a simple
          vanilla cake, so have it whenever the urge to bake takes you. It’s the most basic possible combination of eggs, flour, butter and sugar –
         practically the Platonic ideal of a cake – baked in the oven for 45-50 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when it’s golden on top, and a skewer inserted 
         into its side comes out clean.</p>
