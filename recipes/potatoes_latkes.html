    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which 
        is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other
         recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.
